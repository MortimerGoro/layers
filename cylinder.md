### Cylinder Layer
The cylinder layer is similar to quad layer: it is an object in the world with image mapped onto the inside of a cylinder section. It can be imagined the same way a curved TV set display looks to a viewer. Only the internal surface of the layer **must** be rendered; the exterior of the cylinder is not visible and **must not** be rendered by the browser.

See `XRQuadLayer` for common attributes' description.

The cylinder-specific attributes are as follows:
* `pose` - the `XRRigidTransform`, defines position and orientation of the center point of the view of the cylinder in the reference space of the `space`;
* `radius` - the radius of the cylinder.
* `centralAngle` - is the angle of the visible section of the cylinder, in radians, from 0 (inclusive) to 2 x PI (exclusive). It grows symmetrically around the 0 radian angle.
* `aspectRatio` - is the aspect ratio of the visible cylinder section, width / height. The height of the cylinder height is calculated as follows: `height = radius * centralAngle) / aspectRatio`.
